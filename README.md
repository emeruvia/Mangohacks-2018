# Mangohacks-2018 
## JP Morgan Challenge Project
We choose to work on the JP Morgan Challenge<br>
Project done for MangoHacks 2018, held at FIU from March 2nd to March 4th. It was a 36 hour event.
## Project-Idea
The project is a system in which companies can upload content, comment, and give props to other posts. The whole system is to be used by small companies to interact with one another. In the future we hope to add geobased information. So Miami area would have its own content and Tampa's content would be local to it. Bigger companies would be able to interact with smaller companies on a more informal basis, perhaps seeing progressing. Tailoring better incentives based off the popularity in the area's posting
